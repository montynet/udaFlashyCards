# udaFlashyCards
This project is developed using React.js, React Native, Expo, Redux, and 
the many packages that help these libraries play nice.

## Getting Started

You will need to have yarn installed, although node equivalent will work
just as well.

Clone this repository
```
git clone <repo_url>
```

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
Then you can use the [expo app](https://expo.io/) to see the app on your mobile

## Supported Devices
* Android (tested on this)
* iOS (in theory it should work :-) )

## Built With

* [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - IDE that I like using.
* [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v34.0.0/workflow/up-and-running/)
